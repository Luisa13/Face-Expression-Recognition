# **Face Expression Recognition**

> **WARNING**: this project and hence this explanation, is not ready yet but will be very soon!

This is a basic computer vision project solving the problem of emotion facial recognition. It uses OpenCv as a library for computer vision Flask in the client side which allows deploy the application into a web interface and Keras to build up and train the model. 

Alongside you can find the [data set here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge) which played part in Kaggle contest *“Challenges in Representation Learning: Facial Expression Recognition Challenge”:*
